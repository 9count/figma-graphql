This was how we could get the name of a text element in a document:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-gql\"\n      }}>{`{\n    file(id: \"cLp23bR627jcuNSoBGkhL04E\") {\n        pages {\n            frames {\n                elements(type: \"TEXT\") {\n                    name\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`We had to follow the structure of the file and know exactly where the element was to get the information we need.

It will return `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`any`}</strong>{` text element that is a child of `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`any`}</strong>{` frame that is part of `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`any`}</strong>{` page in the file.`}</p>\n    <p>{`In this query `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`texts`}</inlineCode>{`, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`frames`}</inlineCode>{` and `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`pages`}</inlineCode>{` are shortcuts and don't behave the same way as in v1. These shortcuts respect the query structure so they will only match the nodes that respect the same hierarchy in the document.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This also means that we could even simplify this query if we just want the name of all the text elements in a file, no matter where they are placed:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-gql\"\n      }}>{`{\n    file(id: \"cLp23bR627jcuNSoBGkhL04E\") {\n        texts {\n            name\n        }\n    }\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`This gives a lot of flexibility and takes away the complexity of the structure of the file from the user by default.`}</p>\n    <p>{`And that was the main motivation to build the v2 of figma-graphql: to make a human-first API for Figma.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"unified-query\"\n    }}>{`Unified query`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Another aspect that we briefly mentioned above is the fact that we weren't taking advantage of the power of abstraction in GraphQL. We had the `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`file`}</inlineCode>{` query but also mapped all the different API end points to separate queries like `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`images`}</inlineCode>{`, `}<inlineCode parentName=\"p\">{`comments`}</inlineCode>{`, etc.`}</p>\n    <p>{`This is still possible and we kept the support from v1, but it's no longer recommended.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Instead, we are now stitching together the different queries into a single query that can do all the actions supported by the multiple queries in v1 with the added bonus that it makes the queries much easier to understand.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Let's look at this query for example:`}</p>\n    <pre><code parentName=\"pre\" {...{\n        \"className\": \"language-gql\"\n      }}>{`{\n    projects(teamId: \"teamID\") {\n        name\n        files {\n            name\n            frames {\n                export\n            }\n            comments {\n                message\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n`}</code></pre>\n    <p>{`This is using just the team ID as a starting point to get through all the different projects inside a team, then get all the files for each project and then export all frames from each file in the default jpg format as well as getting all the comments associated with each file. `}</p>\n    <p>{`It might seem a simple query but it's in fact using four different endpoints and making several requests to get all that information. But it does that in a way that is completely hidden to the user, who doesn't have to deal witht the complexity of the system.`}</p>\n    <p>{`By making these properties available in their context we make the query much more natural and augment the capababilities of the existing REST API. `}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"],"sourceRoot":""}
